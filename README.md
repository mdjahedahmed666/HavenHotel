# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Here are five key points about the project:

1. **Room Information**: Users can explore detailed information about different rooms, including room name, description, price per night, room size, availability, and special offers.

2. **Room Booking**: Authenticated users can book a room, and the system maintains availability status. Users are redirected to the login page if they are not authenticated.

3. **User Reviews**: Authenticated users can post reviews for specific rooms. Reviews are filtered by room name to provide relevant feedback.

4. **Authentication**: The project uses authentication to distinguish between logged-in and anonymous users. Only authenticated users can book rooms and post reviews.

5. **User-Friendly**: The client-side features a user-friendly interface, responsive design, and interactive elements such as modals and alert dialogs for an enhanced user experience.
